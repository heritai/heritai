# 👋 Hi, I'm Yousef Taheri!  

🚀 I work at the intersection of machine learning, applied research, and responsible AI.
I’m especially interested in building intelligent systems that are interpretable, scalable, and aligned with real-world constraints like fairness and compliance.

### 🔧 **Tech Stack & Skills**  
- **Programming**: Python (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy), R, Java, Prolog, ASP  
- **AI & ML Tools**: MLflow, LangChain, LangGraph, Crewai  
- **Deployment**: Docker, Flask, Git  
- **Databases**: SQL, Neo4j, Spark, SQL  
- **Other**: Data Visualization, Statistical Analysis.  

### 💡 **What I Work On**  
🔹 Currently Exploring: **development** and **deployment** of AI systems, **LLMs** and **generative AI** applications, RAGs, etc.
