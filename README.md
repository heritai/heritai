### **ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My GitHub!**  

Hi, I'm **Yousef Taheri**, a PhD in Artificial Intelligence with a passion for **Machine Learning, NLP, Symbolic AI, and AI Safety**.  

- ðŸ”¹ **Interests:** Genereative AI, Symbolic AI, LLMs, Statistical Data Analysis
- ðŸ”¹ **Tech Stack:** Python (Pytorch, Scikit-learn), R, Answer Set Programming
- ðŸ”¹ **Currently Exploring:** Reasoning and Knowledge Representatin, ML interpretability, LLMs, RAGs, etc.  

Feel free to explore my repositories, and donâ€™t hesitate to **connect or collaborate!** ðŸš€  

Here, I share code from **various projects, research experiments, and courses**. 
- You'll find implementations of **ML models, Deep learing architectures, Reinforcement learning algorithms, AI reasoning, and more**.
- The following table lists these codes along with details about the datasets and their application domains.
